Changelog:

New Features

 - Cross-platform support: Windows, Linux and possibly other UNIX-likes
 - Configurable windowing + renderer, input and audio backends
 - Save game list is sorted so that latest save is at the top
 - Configurable number of quicksave slots
 - Shortcut to toggle windowed and fullscreen mode (default is Alt+Enter)
 - Video config menu displays the aspect ratio along with resolutions
 - Separated window size and fullscreen resolution
 - Added an "automatic" fullscreen resolution setting that always chooses
   the highest available one

Fixed Bugs

 - Fixed aspect ratio for interface elements when using non 5:4-resolutions
   (some are still stretched)
 - Fixed various crashes
 - Improved level loading speed by limiting the progress bar update rate

Technical Changes

 - Ported text rendering from Windows GDI to Freetype
 - Removed dependency on the proprietary PKWARE implode library
   - This required changing the savegame format - saves produced by Arx
     Libertatis cannot be read by the original Arx Fatalis, but Arx Libertatis
     can still read the original save files.
 - Abstracted windowing framework, with SDL and Win32 implementations
 - Abstracted audio backend, with OpenAL and DirectSound 9 implementations
 - Abstracted input backend, with SDL and DirectInput 8 implementations
